## Introduction

This document demonstrates how to embed a Shinylive application directly in a Quarto document. The Shiny app runs completely in the browser without requiring a Shiny server.

## Installation Requirements

Before you can use Shinylive with Quarto, you need to:

1. Install Quarto: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/
2. Install the Shinylive extension for Quarto:
   ```bash
   quarto add quarto-ext/shinylive
   ```
3. Make sure you have Python installed with Shiny for Python:
   ```bash
   pip install shiny
   ```

## Example Shinylive App

Here's a simple Shinylive app embedded in our document:

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
#| viewerHeight: 400

from shiny import App, ui, render

app_ui = ui.page_fluid(
    ui.h1("Hello Shinylive in Quarto!"),
    ui.input_slider("n", "Number of observations", 10, 100, 50),
    ui.output_text_verbatim("summary"),
    ui.output_plot("histogram")
)

def server(input, output, session):
    @render.text
    def summary():
        return f"You've selected {input.n()} observations"
    
    @render.plot
    def histogram():
        import numpy as np
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        data = np.random.randn(input.n())
        plt.hist(data, bins=15)
        plt.title("Random Normal Distribution")
        plt.xlabel("Value")
        plt.ylabel("Frequency")
        return plt

app = App(app_ui, server)
```

## Additional Examples

### A Simple Counter App

Here's another simple example of a counter app:

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: horizontal
#| viewerHeight: 300

from shiny import App, ui, reactive

app_ui = ui.page_fluid(
    ui.h3("Simple Counter"),
    ui.input_action_button("increment", "Increment"),
    ui.p(),
    ui.output_text("count_text")
)

def server(input, output, session):
    count = reactive.value(0)
    
    @reactive.effect
    def _():
        if input.increment():
            count.set(count() + 1)
    
    @output
    @render.text
    def count_text():
        return f"Count: {count()}"

app = App(app_ui, server)
```

## How It Works

The Shinylive Quarto extension does the following:

1. It takes your Python Shiny app code
2. Compiles it to WebAssembly with Pyodide
3. Renders it directly in the browser

This means your readers can interact with the Shiny app without needing to install anything or connect to a Shiny server.

## Options

You can customize your Shinylive apps with various options:

- `standalone: true|false` - Whether the app is standalone or shares the Python environment with other code chunks
- `components: [editor, viewer]` - Which components to display
- `layout: vertical|horizontal` - Whether to stack the editor and viewer vertically or horizontally
- `viewerHeight: 400` - Height of the viewer in pixels

## Deployment

When you render your Quarto document, it will include all the necessary JavaScript and WebAssembly files to run your Shiny apps in the browser. You can deploy the rendered HTML document to any static web hosting service.
